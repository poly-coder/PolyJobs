### F#

Implementation of Jobs service in F#.

#### Domain

#### Validation

Validation can be performed using the abstraction `Result<'T, 'TErrors>`.

There are multiple libraries that can be used to perform validation:

- [FsToolkit.ErrorHandling](https://github.com/demystifyfp/FsToolkit.ErrorHandling)
  Is a library that provide a lots of CE for working with `Option<'a>`, `Result<'a, 'e>`, `Async<'a>` and `Task<'a>`.

  It also provide some CEs for combinations of the previous, like `Result<'a option, 'e>`, `Async<Result<'a, 'e>>` and `Task<Result<'a, 'e>>`. Also, the more advanced `Async<Result<'a option, 'e>>` and `Result<'a, 'e list>`.

  It lacks structure for validation, like having property path and error message, but it can be very useful for simple validation and using their CEs.

- [Validus](https://github.com/pimbrouwers/Validus)
  Is a library that provide a structure for validation, like having property path and error message.

  Its main type definition is `ValidationResult<'a> = Result<'a, ValidationErrors>`, where `ValidationErrors` represents a map of property paths to error messages list.

  It also contains a `Validator` type, a `validate` CE and a `Check` module with some prebuilt validations.

  It lacks support for async validations, but if necessary, it can be implemented using the `AsyncResult` type from `FsToolkit.ErrorHandling`.

- [FSharp.Control.FusionTasks](https://github.com/kekyo/FSharp.Control.FusionTasks)
  It is a library that provide some extensions to `Async` and `Task` workflows, to use them interchangeably.
